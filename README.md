# Toy-Project
Part of an interactive diorama/playset.
I have very little experience and just as much knowledge about coding. Learning curve is a bit slow, but I'm able to have fun with it. I'm learning coding to be able to implement and fashion my ideas to fruition instead of paying someone else. I come from toy making and video engineering backgrounds, with years of outsourcing my programming.
